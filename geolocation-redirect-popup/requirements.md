# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement an automatic geolocation-based popup system for a Shopify theme that detects users' locations and prompts them to shop in their local currency and language when available. The system will enhance user experience by providing localized shopping options while respecting user preferences and privacy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a store visitor, I want to be automatically prompted to shop in my local currency and language when I visit the website, so that I can have a more personalized shopping experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website for the first time THEN the system SHALL detect their geolocation using browser APIs
2. WHEN the user's location is detected THEN the system SHALL check if a matching currency and language combination is available
3. WHEN a matching localization is found THEN the system SHALL display a popup suggesting the user switch to their local settings
4. WHEN the user accepts the suggestion THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the appropriate localized version of the site
5. WHEN the user declines the suggestion THEN the system SHALL remember their choice and not show the popup again for that session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want to configure which countries and currencies are supported through theme settings, so that I can control which localizations are offered to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing theme settings THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration section for geolocation settings
2. WHEN configuring geolocation settings THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling the geolocation popup feature
3. WHEN configuring supported regions THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and use Shopify Markets configuration
4. WHEN Shopify Markets are configured THEN the system SHALL map countries to their corresponding market settings
5. WHEN saving configuration THEN the system SHALL validate that all mapped currencies and languages are supported by the configured Shopify Markets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the geolocation popup to respect my privacy and preferences, so that I feel comfortable using the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the geolocation detection fails or is blocked THEN the system SHALL gracefully continue without showing the popup
2. WHEN a user has previously dismissed the popup THEN the system SHALL not show it again during the same browser session
3. WHEN a user has already selected a currency/language manually THEN the system SHALL not override their choice with the popup
4. WHEN the popup is displayed THEN it SHALL include clear options to accept, decline, or dismiss
5. WHEN a user clears their browser data THEN the system SHALL treat them as a new visitor and may show the popup again

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want the geolocation system to work seamlessly with Shopify's built-in localization features and Markets, so that currency and language switching functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN redirecting users THEN the system SHALL use Shopify Markets URLs and native localization parameters
2. WHEN switching currencies THEN the system SHALL ensure product prices update correctly using Shopify Markets pricing
3. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL ensure all translatable content displays in the selected language from Markets configuration
4. WHEN users navigate the site THEN the system SHALL maintain their selected market and localization preferences
5. WHEN the localization changes THEN the system SHALL update any currency selectors or language switchers to reflect the current Markets settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the geolocation system to be performant and not impact site loading speed, so that user experience remains optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the geolocation detection SHALL not block the main content rendering
2. WHEN geolocation APIs are slow or unavailable THEN the system SHALL timeout after a reasonable period (3-5 seconds)
3. WHEN displaying the popup THEN it SHALL load asynchronously without affecting page performance
4. WHEN storing user preferences THEN the system SHALL use efficient client-side storage methods
5. WHEN the feature is disabled THEN it SHALL not load any related JavaScript or make unnecessary API calls

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want to track how users interact with the geolocation popup, so that I can measure its effectiveness and optimize the feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup is displayed THEN the system SHALL track this event for analytics
2. WHEN users accept the localization suggestion THEN the system SHALL record the acceptance and target localization
3. WHEN users decline the suggestion THEN the system SHALL record the decline and their detected location
4. WHEN geolocation detection fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason for debugging
5. WHEN users interact with the popup THEN the system SHALL provide data that can be integrated with existing analytics tools
##
# Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a store owner, I want to fully customize the appearance and content of the geolocation popup, so that it matches my brand and provides the right messaging to my customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN configuring popup content THEN the system SHALL allow editing all text including title, description, and button labels
3. WHEN configuring popup layout THEN the system SHALL provide options for popup size, position, and animation effects
4. WHEN configuring popup timing THEN the system SHALL allow setting delay before showing popup and auto-dismiss timing
5. WHEN configuring popup behavior THEN the system SHALL allow choosing between modal overlay, corner notification, or banner styles
6. WHEN previewing changes THEN the system SHALL provide a preview mode to see popup appearance before publishing
7. WHEN using multiple languages THEN the system SHALL allow translating all popup text for each supported language in Shopify Markets
