### 2. Shopify Markets Configuration

Before enabling the geolocation popup, ensure your Shopify Markets are properly configured:

1. Go to Settings > Markets in your Shopify admin
2. Add the countries/regions you want to support
3. Configure currencies and languages for each market
4. Set up any market-specific pricing or content

### 3. Theme Integration

The popup is automatically integrated into your theme through the `layout/theme.liquid` file. The integration includes:

- CSS stylesheet loading
- JavaScript configuration with theme settings
- Shopify localization data injection
- Fallback for JavaScript-disabled users

## Configuration Options

### Theme Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `geolocation_popup_enabled` | boolean | false | Enable/disable the popup |
| `geolocation_popup_style` | select | "modal" | Popup style (modal/corner/banner) |
| `geolocation_popup_position` | select | "center" | Popup position |
| `geolocation_popup_delay` | range | 2000 | Delay before showing popup (ms) |
| `geolocation_popup_auto_dismiss` | range | 0 | Auto dismiss time (0 = disabled) |
| `geolocation_popup_animation` | select | "fade" | Animation type |
| `geolocation_popup_title` | text | "Shop in your local currency" | Popup title |
| `geolocation_popup_message` | textarea | Default message | Popup message with placeholders |
| `geolocation_popup_accept_button` | text | "Yes, switch to {currency}" | Accept button text |
| `geolocation_popup_decline_button` | text | "No, keep current settings" | Decline button text |
| Color and styling options | color/range | Various | Visual customization |

### JavaScript Configuration

The popup behavior can be controlled through the `window.geolocationPopupSettings` object:

```javascript
window.geolocationPopupSettings = {
  enabled: true,
  style: 'modal',
  delay: 2000,
  timeout: 5000,
  analyticsEnabled: true,
  // ... other settings
};
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

Once configured, the popup works automatically. When a visitor arrives:

1. The system waits for the configured delay
2. Detects the user's location using browser geolocation
3. Matches the location against available Shopify Markets
4. Shows the popup if a different market is available
5. Handles user interaction (accept/decline)
6. Redirects to the appropriate market if accepted

### Manual Control

You can also control the popup programmatically:

```javascript
// Create and initialize service
const service = new GeolocationPopupService(window.geolocationPopupSettings);

// Manual initialization
service.initialize();

// Show popup manually
service.show();

// Hide popup
service.hide();

// Reset user preferences
service.reset();
```

### Testing and Development

Use the test suite for development and debugging:

```javascript
// Run all tests
GeolocationPopupTests.runAllTests();

// Simulate geolocation for testing
GeolocationPopupTests.simulateGeolocation('CA'); // Canada
GeolocationPopupTests.simulateGeolocation('GB'); // United Kingdom

// Reset user preferences
GeolocationPopupTests.resetPreferences();
```

## Performance Considerations

The implementation includes several performance optimizations:

### Lazy Loading
- Popup initialization is deferred using `requestIdleCallback`
- Resources are only loaded when needed
- User preferences are checked before initialization

### Memory Management
- Event listeners are properly cleaned up
- Timers are cleared on page unload
- DOM elements are removed after use

### Network Optimization
- Geolocation API has a reasonable timeout (5 seconds)
- Reverse geocoding uses efficient external service
- Preconnection headers for external services

### Browser Compatibility
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported features
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Accessibility Features

The popup is designed with accessibility in mind:

- **ARIA Support**: Proper roles, labels, and modal attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Descriptive text and labels
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling for modal dialogs
- **High Contrast Support**: CSS for high contrast and dark modes
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting

## Privacy and Compliance

The implementation respects user privacy:

- **Geolocation Permission**: Uses browser's native permission system
- **Graceful Failures**: Continues without popup if geolocation fails
- **User Choice**: Always allows users to decline
- **Session Storage**: Preferences are stored per session only
- **No Personal Data**: No personal information is stored

## Analytics and Tracking

The system tracks the following events:

- `popup_displayed` - When popup is shown to user
- `user_accepted` - When user accepts the suggestion
- `user_declined` - When user declines the suggestion
- `geolocation_error` - When geolocation detection fails

Analytics data includes:
- Detected country and suggested currency
- Current vs. suggested localization
- Error types and messages
- Session information for aggregation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Popup doesn't appear:**
1. Check that the feature is enabled in theme settings
2. Verify Shopify Markets are configured
3. Ensure user hasn't already declined
4. Check browser console for errors

**Geolocation fails:**
1. Verify HTTPS is enabled (required for geolocation)
2. Check browser permissions
3. Test with different browsers
4. Monitor network requests to geolocation service

**Styling issues:**
1. Check for CSS conflicts with theme
2. Verify custom color settings
3. Test responsive design on different devices
4. Check for high contrast mode compatibility

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:

```javascript
window.geolocationPopupDebug = true;
```

This will provide detailed console logging for troubleshooting.

## Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 11+, Chrome Mobile 60+
- **Geolocation API**: Required for location detection
- **Local Storage**: Required for preference management
- **Fetch API**: Required for network requests

### Fallback Behavior

For unsupported browsers:
- Popup is not shown
- No errors are thrown
- Site continues to function normally
- Manual localization controls remain available

## Performance Metrics

Expected performance characteristics:

- **Initialization**: < 50ms
- **Popup Creation**: < 10ms
- **Memory Usage**: < 1MB
- **Network Requests**: 1-2 per session
- **Bundle Size**: ~15KB minified

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **IP-based Fallback**: Alternative to geolocation API
2. **A/B Testing**: Built-in testing capabilities
3. **Advanced Targeting**: Time-based or behavior-based triggers
4. **Multi-language Support**: Dynamic text translation
5. **Custom Animations**: More animation options
6. **Integration APIs**: Webhooks for external systems

## Support and Maintenance

For issues or questions:

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify theme settings configuration
3. Test with the provided test suite
4. Review Shopify Markets setup
5. Check this documentation for troubleshooting

The implementation follows Shopify theme development best practices and is designed to be maintainable and extensible for future requirements.
